# MTA Metrocard Reader

This program allows a person to read a New York MTA metro card. The program was originally made by sephail a few years ago. Around 2017, Linxin took a interest in the program and updated it to its current version today.  Later on, mantie uploaded the program to github. This program is for research and educational purposes only. 


### Requirements 

For Now, this program only runs on mac and Linux systems that natively come built in with python. 
A card reader/writer that is able to read tracks 1, 2, and 3.  A good example of this would be the misiri MS705x.  Finally, solder the 3.5 mm audio cable to the motherboard of the card reader.
